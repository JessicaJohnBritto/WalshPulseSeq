# WPSProtocol

This is developed as part of my summer internship at LPMMC, UGA-CNRS, Grenoble, France. 

WPSProtocol makes use of Walsh Functions to generate Pulse Sequences for selective interactions among qubits based on the underlying XY Hamiltonian.

WPSProtocol contains codes for implementing the protocol described in this paper Votto, M., Zeiher, J., & Vermersch, B. (2023). Robust universal quantum processors in spin systems via Walsh pulse sequences. arXiv preprint arXiv:2311.10600.
