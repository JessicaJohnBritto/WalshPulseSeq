        Dynamical Decoupling Protocol uses Walsh Functions to generate (Walsh) Pulse Sequences for selective interactions in Qubits.
        This protocol is based on the work by Votto, M., Zeiher, J., & Vermersch, B. (2023). Robust universal quantum processors in spin systems via Walsh pulse sequences. arXiv preprint     
        arXiv:2311.10600.
